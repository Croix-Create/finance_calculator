### finance_calculator.py
This is a finance calculator I made for my first Python capstone project.
This project's aim was to familiarise oneself with control structures and syntax in Python.

This project made use of the following technologies:
Python 3.9.0
Visual Studio Code

# The How
The user is asked to either enter 'investment' or 'bond' to get an expected result. The input is altered with the .lower() function in order to make sure all inputs are matched 
with what the control structures are looking for.
Once a control structure is selected, more inputs are required to make a calculation.
If investment is selected one will have to choose between simple or compound interest. Once either of these are selected a fucntion call will be made. The function will then calculate the sum and print the result in the console.


# The Why
The user is required by the program to enter in specific details depedning on wether 'investment' or 'bond' are selected. The purpose of this program is to aid the user in determining how much money they can make if that invest their money via a simple or compound method.
Additionally the option to caculate one's bond is also present. This can be used to caculate the price of the bond per month.
